# Playlet features

These many of the features of Playlet. Some are obvious, some are less known.

## No Ads

This is obvious; Playlet does not show ads. This is possible because it is not a sort of ad-blocker, but it is a standalone app written from the ground up.

## SponsorBlock

Playlet implements [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) which helps automatically skip sponsored sections in the videos (which are essentially a form of advertising)

You can enable/disable SponsorBlock from the settings.

## Picture-in-picture

Playlet has a "Picture-in-picture" mode, which consists of minizing the video player to a smaller size. It is useful so that you can play something in the background, while you browse videos and decide on what to watch next.

- When viewing a video in full screen, press ⬇️ (down) button on your remote to shrink the video
- To restore currently playing video to full screen, press the ✳️ (options) button
