            For some strange reason, the "author" field can only be set once.
            If you try to set it again, it will not be updated, with type mismatch warning:
            
            =================================================================
            Warning occurred while setting a field of an RoSGNode
             - Type mismatch occurred when setting the "author" field of a "PlaylistContentNode" node
               at line 112 of file InvidiousToContentNode__lib0.brs
            =================================================================

            This is very strange, because checking the types, everything seems to be correct.
            The issue does not happen on ANY field, only "author".
            My wild guess is some hardcoded bs on Roku's side.
            This is why "_author" is used instead of "author".

            Although we use the field "author" in other components, this is the only place where we modify it after
            we set it for the first time (because a saved Playlist belongs to the Invidious user at first, but then
            we can query it's original owner)
